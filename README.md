## Features

- User Authentication: Users can register and log in to save their personalized settings and lists.

- Dynamic Categories: Five customizable dropdown categories that users can edit, reorder, and manage.

- Editable Lists: Users can add, edit, and delete links within each category.

- Persistent Data: All user data is stored in a database, ensuring that users can access their personalized dashboard from any device.

### How It Works
